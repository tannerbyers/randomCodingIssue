# Random Coding Issue Website
randomcodingissue.com

**Issue logger website**

So think stack overflow but instead of the person posting a question and waiting for people to respond, people post their errors and how the resolved them. I wanna make it easy for people to share resolutions for little issues that people have when coding. Save time for others devs.


## Infastructure

Frontend: NextJs (I'm very comfortable w/ jsx and react)
Backend: NodeJs (I'm very comfortable w/ js)
Database: Mongodb (Their free cloud option is nice)

Posts will be saved in database 

--- 
### Things to consider:
* Will new "posts" be moderated? 

### TO DO
---
#### Search Issues 
* Add post for Search Bar to get issues
* Add API route for get request 
* Have API resposne return json result for posts
* Make compoennt for "post" from response

#### Post Issues/Resolutions

My first issue 
Backspace was not working. 

Was getting error:
command 'markdown.extension.onBackspaceKey' not found

Issue was related to the `Markdown All in One` plugin in the VS Code Appstore. Uninstalled for now will look further into this later.
